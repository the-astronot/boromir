# BOROMIR

## Description

The Blender-based Open-source Repository for Opnav Moon Image Rendering (BOROMIR) is a utility for generating simulated images of the Moon from lunar orbit.

## Abstract

BOROMIR utilizes digital elevation maps (DEMs) and albedo maps of the Moon to generate meshes and create simulated images from a camera state and time (Sun, Earth position). For each image/set, BOROMIR determines what portion of the Moon is visible to the camera, and creates a mesh for that section, which is then rendered via Blender. Crucially, a metadata file is also created, specifying all of the known state data and other info required to recreate the image. This can be useful when it is necessary to have access to both an image of the Moon as well as the camera state when it was taken.

### Standalone Renders

Here is a small collection of images generated by BOROMIR to give you some sense of what it is capable of.

### Comparisons

Here are my attempts at recreating actual images. NOTE: These were accomplished by feeding the approximate camera state and time of image capture into the software.

## Installation

Installation/Setup information is outlined in [SETUP](docs/SETUP.md). Unfortunately it can still be a bit involved at the moment, too long to cover here.

## Usage

BOROMIR is run from the commandline. The main bash file can be found in the bin/ directory and added to your $PATH. Running as below will show the help page.

``` bash
boromir -h
```

At present, BOROMIR has two options for generating states/images, RANDOM and TRAJECTORY. RANDOM takes a config file as argument for specifying the parameters for the random generated states. TRAJECTORY instead takes a CSV file as argument for specifying the exact states which will be used. Essentially, if you just need images under certain conditions (like for generating datasets), RANDOM is the way to go. Alternatively if you have done the work to compute the state for a certain image, then use TRAJECTORY.

Examples of each are shown below.

``` bash
boromir random rand_file.json --num_images=100
```

``` bash
boromir trajectory traj_file.json
```
