The Blender-based Open-source Repository for Opnav Moon Image Rendering (BOROMIR) is a utility for generating simulated images of the Moon from lunar orbit.

At this time, its functionality is limited by the sampling frequencies of the underlying Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and albedo maps to useful minimum altitudes of approximately 1500km above the mean Moon radius at a Field of View (FoV) of 20 degrees and 1920x1080 camera resolution.
